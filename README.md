# Haskell Template

Template for my Haskell + Nix projects

I use this repo to as a starting point for new projects to avoid rewriting
common boilerplate. It's written in a very "batteries included" style - with all
the bells and whistles I might want included - but I usually strip out a lot of
that for smaller projects, or just steal bits and pieces as I go.

It's also nice to capture best practices and my opinions (same thing amirite /s)
on project layout, which I can refer other people to easily.
